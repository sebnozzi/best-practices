# Clean Code

* Code duplication
* Tight coupling
* Dependency injection
  * Be specific on your needs
* Leaking Abstractions
* Don't mix responsibilities
 * Per function
 * Per class
* Code smell: lots of private functions
* Code smell: too large / too much
* Don't mix levels of abstraction
* Single Responsibility Principle

### Communicating Meaning

* Short methods / functions
* Short classes / modules / files
* Meaningful names
* Avoid long invocation chains
  * Describe intermediate steps
* Avoid primitive types
  * Create domain types
